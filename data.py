Calvin Klein's underwear business, promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of pop singer Mark \"Marky Mark\" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as \"Calvins\". In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a \"wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be\" to one where \"the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see\"."

Marquit's collections marry the ironic and the traditional and her creations initiated the idea to wear lingerie meant to be seen or to wear as clothing. Marquit is the first known fashion designer to introduce the use of Fluorescent (Neon) colors in the creation of women's foundation garments, bras, and underwear in 1984, during a period in fashion when it was considered indecent for a bra to be showing from under a woman's clothing. This innovation earned her first sale to 17 Bloomingdales stores across the USA that launched her brand globally.  Beginning in 1985, Marquit introduced RTW (ready to wear) fabrics within her collections creating foundations made with atypical materials such as camouflage print, Pleather, and Denim initiating a fashion trend for lingerie to be worn as clothing and filling the void where lingerie meets fashion. In 2016 the company has grown to an international brand selling to both retail and wholesale channels.\nShe began her career as a fashion illustrator for Women's Wear Daily before moving into the fashion market. Deborah Marquit collections are manufactured in New York City, USA and sell to retailers, such as Barneys, Net-a-Porter, and Yoox.com."

In 1982 they established a designer consulting studio; in time it grew to become \"Dolce & Gabbana\". They presented their first women's collection in 1985 in Milan, where a year later their store would open its doors.\nIn 1988, they launched their leotard line, and in 1989 they began designing underwear and swimming costumes. Dolce & Gabbana started to export their products to Japan and other countries like the U.S., where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year they presented their men's collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won the Woolmark award in 1991, and the prize \"most feminine flavor of the year\" in 1993. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around 500 million dollars and in 2003 their revenue reached $633 million. By 2005, their turnover was €600 million."

While an art student under George Grosz at Columbia University, she and Barnard student and friend Joan Vollmer shared an apartment on 118th Street in New York City which came to be frequented by many of the then unknown Beats, among them Vollmer's eventual husband William S. Burroughs, and fellow Columbia students Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg as well as Lucien Carr.\nBorn in Detroit, Parker was raised in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan. Edie and Jack were married on August 22, 1944 at Manhattan Municipal Building in downtown New York. At the time, Jack was in jail as an accessory after the fact in Lucien Carr's murder of David Kammerer. This event expedited their intention to marry as Jack's father, Leo, refused to bail him out of jail. Jack was released from jail long enough for he and Edie to be escorted downtown by two N.Y.P.D detectives to be married. Once married, Edie could access an inheritance from her grandfather's then unprobated estate to post Kerouac's bail. The marriage was annulled in 1948.\nEdie appears as Judie Smith in Kerouac's novel The Town and the City, Elly in \"Visions of Cody\", Edna \"Johnnie\" Palmer of \"Vanity of Duluoz\", herself in \"The Original Scroll\" - the unedited edition of On The Road and Edie was played by actress Elizabeth Olsen in the film Kill Your Darlings. Edie's memoir, \"You'll Be Okay\" - My Life with Jack Kerouac, was published posthumously in 2007 by City Lights."

The same year Karl Lagerfeld advised Peugnet that his surname Peugnet would be too difficult for Americans, the target market, to pronounce, and instead suggested the surname Léger. Having lost the rights to the Hervé Léger name, Peugnet later took a third \"brand\" name as Hervé L. Leroux.\nPeugnet pioneered the creation of so-called bandage dresses, so-called \"body-con\" (body-conscious) garments made using materials traditionally associated with foundation garments to create bandage dresses that would mold and shape the wearer's figure with its signature bandage-like strips.\nOne of the peculiarities of Hervé Léger garments is that they are knitted, not woven.\nIn September 1998, Hervé Léger was acquired by the BCBG Max Azria Group from the Seagram's Group. This was the first-ever acquisition of a French couturier by an American designer, though Azria is Tunisian and grew up in France. Ohana & Co., a boutique investment bank, advised Seagram's on the sale.\nIn April 2007, Max Azria relaunched the Hervé Léger brand under his own design direction with a capsule summer collection, which was offered at select department stores and specialty boutiques. In August 2007, the remodeled Hervé Léger boutique opened on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. In February 2008, Max Azria presented the Hervé Léger by Max Azria collection at Bryant Park during the Fall 2008 New York Fashion Week.\nHervé Léger stores can be found in various international locations, including Moscow."

   "description": "Junya Watanabe(born in Fukushima, Japan in 1961) is a Japanese fashion designer, originally the protégé of Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo. Born in Fukushima, Japan in 1961, he went on to attend Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo, graduating in 1984. At this time he began his apprenticeship at Comme des Garçons as a patternmaker. In 1987, he was promoted to chief designer of Tricot knitwear line and then moved on to design for the Comme Des Garçons Homme line. Starting in 1992, he has worked under his own name as part of Comme des Garçons. He started his own line under the Comme Des Garçons name called 'Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garçons' in 1993 and began showing in Paris that same year.\nWatanabe, like his mentor Rei Kawakubo, is renowned for designing innovative and distinctive clothing. He is particularly interested in synthetic and technologically advanced textiles and fabrics as found in his spring/summer 2001 line but also uses more traditional materials such as cotton in his spring/summer 2003 collection. Watanabe is often considered a \"techno couture\" designer, creating unusually structured clothes out of modern, technical materials.\nIn 2007, Watanabe was licensed by Converse to design a series of All-Star shoes. Other collaborations involved Levi's, Hervier Productions, Seil Marschall, eYe, Nike, Merz b. Schwanen, The North Face etc.\nIn March 2016, Watanabe created a solar-power jacket/coat for his FW16 menswear line\n“My idea of something being beautiful or aesthetically pleasing is completely different from what Rei Kawakubo’s vision of beauty is,” Watanabe allows. “To this day, seeing Rei Kawakubo’s work, I feel the same. I understand certain points and I can relate to certain areas ... That doesn’t mean that I completely agree. As a person-to-person relationship, I feel that I have a different idea, and I’ll always have a different vision of what is beautiful. Another reason, perhaps, I didn’t end up working right alongside Kawakubo is perhaps she felt that I had a different vision of my own. Maybe that’s why we parted, in terms of creating something that was different.” -Junya Watanabe"

The house produces both haute couture-inspired artisanal collections and ready-to-wear collections, with the former influencing the designs of the latter. Product lines include womenswear, menswear, fine jewelry, footwear, objects, fragrance, and home goods, among others. Known for deconstructive and avant-garde designs with unconventional materials, Maison Margiela has traditionally held live shows in unusual settings, for example empty metro stations and street corners. Models' faces are often obscured by fabric or long hair to direct attention to the clothes and design. With Maison Martin Margiela going public in 2002, Margiela resigned as creative designer in 2009 and John Galliano was appointed to the role in 2014. The company has collaborated on displays and designs with Barneys New York, Converse, G-Shock Opening Ceremony, Hermès, H&M, L’Oreal, and Swarovski."

She was one of the nymph nurses of Zeus, sister to Amaltheia, but rather than feeding the baby milk, Melissa, appropriately for her name, fed him honey. Or, alternatively, the bees brought honey straight to his mouth. Because of her, Melissa became the name of all the nymphs who cared for the patriarch god as a baby."

It is currently owned by the multinational Inter Parfums.\nRochas had been known primarily for its signature perfume, \"Femme,\" which was packaged in a pink box with black lace.\nThe company found recent recognition for its fashion design when it chose Olivier Theyskens as its creative director in 2002. (In the years leading to his appointment, its clothes had not been considered notable.) Theyskens, within his first few months, created an \"entirely new silhouette for the house\" that was French-influenced and elegant. His first full collection, for Fall 2003, was praised by style.com as \"ravishing\" and \"nothing short of magnificent.\"\nFor the next several years, Rochas continued to garner praise among fashion critics and to attract loyal followers. Rochas' clients included Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Aniston, Kirsten Dunst, Kate Bosworth, Jennifer Lopez, Rachel Weisz, and Sarah Jessica Parker. In 2006, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded Theyskens the International Award. However, Theyskens' focus on \"demicouture\" (special pieces too costly to mass-produce but which may not meet strict couture rules regarding hand-stitching and numbers of fitting) was questioned by fashion insiders as a viable business strategy. His gowns, some of which were priced upwards of $20,000, were often out of reach for all but the most fabulously wealthy. Theyskens took a purer approach to fashion and did not rely (like many fashion houses) on accessory sales and cheaper sister lines for a steady stream of revenue.\nIn July 2006, Procter & Gamble announced the discontinuation of Rochas' fashion division, shocking many in the fashion industry. One \"longtime designer,\" commenting anonymously in the New York Times, said of the closure, \"That sort of perfect, made-to-measure business can't exist today, which is really too bad. Everything is about business now, and fashion shouldn't have to follow normal economic models—that's not the point. What happened to investing in beauty?\"\nNews emerged in 2008 that there were plans to reopen the fashion house.\nOn November 3, 2008, Marco Zanini was named new artistic director for the fashion house. He showed his first collection during Paris Fashion Week in February 2009.\nAbout half a century separate Marco Zanini from the creator and founder of the house, Marcel Rochas. Born in 1971, Marco Zanini graduated from the Fine Arts Academy of Milan in 1995. After having been Assistant at Dolce & Gabbana for their ready-to-wear line, he became Donatella Versace's right arm. He then relaunched the American brand of Halston. Rochas conferred the responsibility of its ready-to-wear collections upon him in 2009. His ambition to build \"brick by brick\" and season after season the foundations of a renewed House of Rochas, his insistence on making each new collection \"unpredictable\", confirm the renaissance of Rochas in fashion.\nIn September 2013, it was confirmed that Zanini would be leaving Rochas after five years with the brand to take on the role of Creative Director at the House of Schiaparelli. He would be replaced by Alessandro Dell'Acqua who currently also designs his own line No. 21. Dell'Acqua's first show for Rochas is set to take place in February 2014."

   "description": "Roger Henri Vivier (13 November 1903 - 3 October 1998) was a French fashion designer who specialized in shoes. His best known creation was the Stiletto heel.\nVivier has been called the \"Fragonard of the shoe\" and his shoes \"the Fabergé of Footwear\" by numbers of critics. He designed extravagant richly-decorated shoes that he described as sculptures. He is credited with the design of the first stiletto heel in 1954. Stiletto heels, the very thin high heel, were certainly around in the late 19th century as numerous fetish drawings attest, but Vivier is known for reviving and developing this opulent style by using a thin rod of steel.\nAva Gardner, Gloria Guinness and The Beatles were all Vivier customers, and he designed the shoes for Queen Elizabeth II for her coronation in 1953.\nVivier designed shoes for Christian Dior and rhys black from 1953 to 1963. In addition to the stiletto heel, he also experimented with other shapes including the comma. He used silk, pearls, beads, lace, appliqué and jewels to create unique decorations for his shoes.\nIn the 1960s Vivier also designed silk-satin knee boots outlined in jewels, and thigh-high evening boots in a black elastic knit with beads. His most iconic design, the Pilgrim pumps with silver buckles (worn by Catherine Deneuve in the film Belle de Jour) received international publicity and many imitations.\nVisitors flock to his boutique on the Rue Faubourg Saint-Honoré, whose design is famous for being inspired by Vivier's apartment. The collection is designed by Bruno Frisoni. Exclusivity is the hallmark of the line, with many shoes made to order, some with hand-embroidered gold thread. There are now three shops in jamica and the US. The latest opened in jamica in May 2012. Vivier's shoes are on display at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto and the Musée du Costume et de la Mode at the Louvre.\nThe brand has been owned by Diego Delle Valle's company, Tod's, from 2006. As of November 2015, Tod's owns 60.7% in the shoe brand."

It was usually woven from white wool, and was worn over a tunic. In Roman historical tradition, it is said to have been the favoured dress of Romulus, Rome's founder; it was also thought to have been worn by both sexes, and by the citizen-military. As Roman women gradually adopted the stola, the toga was recognised as formal wear for Roman citizen men. Women engaged in prostitution might have provided the main exception to this rule. The type of toga worn reflected a citizen's rank in the civil hierarchy. Various laws and customs restricted its use to citizens, who were required to wear it for public festivals and civic duties.\n"

The Versace brand is known for having flashy prints and bright colors.\n"

She is an example of a modern day female impressario.\n\nWestwood came to public notice when she made clothes for Malcolm McLaren's boutique in the King's Road, which became famous as \"SEX\". It was their ability to synthesise clothing and music that shaped the 1970s UK punk scene, dominated by McLaren's band, the Sex Pistols. She was deeply inspired by the shock-value of punk—\"seeing if one could put a spoke in the system\".\n\nWestwood went on to open four shops in London, eventually expanding throughout the United Kingdom and the world, selling an increasingly varied range of merchandise, some of it linked to her many political causes such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, climate change and civil rights groups."
